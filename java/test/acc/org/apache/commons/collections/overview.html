<h3>Apache Commons Collections Test Framework</h3>

<p>
The Collections Test Framework is an extension to JUnit to enable quick and easy testing
of collections. The collections interfaces are large and complex to test thoroughly.
These classes do most of the testing for you, and offer configuration by overriding methods
when your collection bends the API. All you have to do is actually write the collection
and make it pass.

<p>
The test framework does not depend on the main commons-collections jar file.
The only exception to this are the <code>Bag</code> tests, but if you are testing this
you must have the collections jar anyway.

<p>
NOTE: The test framework is released to aid developers.
We will try to make changes backwards compatible.
However, if necessary changes will be made to the test framework to improve the tests.
