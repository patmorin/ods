latex/ contains the latex sources
java/ods contains the java sources
cpp contains the C++ sources (still under development)

To make the books (ods-java.pdf and ods-cpp.pdf):
  cd latex ; make
This will require a decent installation of pdflatex, perl, ipe, inkscape,
gnuplot, and pdftk.

To make the Java archive ods.jar:
  cd java ; make

To make both:
  make

What's in here:
  java/test    - Test code from Sun/Oracle and Apache
  java/junk    - Small sample code snippets used in the text
  java/ods     - The Java data structures sources
  cpp          - The C++ data structures sources and sample code
  latex        - The book's latex source code and scripts
  latex/figs   - The book's ipe figures
  latex/images - Images used in the book


How it works:
The Makefile and Perl script in ./latex do the following:
  1. Convert ipe figures in ./latex/figs into pdf
  2. Convert svg figures in ./latex/images into pdf
  3. Scan the latex sources and generate -java.tex and -cpp.tex files
     that include source code from ./java and ./cpp directories
  4. Run pdflatex and bibtex to generate the file ods-java.pdf and
     ods-cpp.pdf
