In the last module we studied the ArrayStack implementation of a List.
In this implementation, the list elements are stored in an array, $a$.
Occasionally, $a$ gets too full or too empty and has to be resized.
<p>
To make things easy, we studied the efficiency of the ArrayStack
operations by ignoring the cost of these resize() operations.
<p>
Now it's time to show that these resize operations don't add much
to the overall running-time.  We'll do this using a technique called
<em>amortized analysis</em>, in which we study the running time of a
whole sequence of operations.
<div class="pause">1</div>
For an ArrayStack, this means that we'll study the total time spent
resizing when we start with an empty ArrayStack and perform a sequence of
$m$ add and remove operations.  In particular, we'll show that the total
time spent in calls to the resize() function is only proportional to $m$.
<p>
Although the cost of resizing varies from one add or remove operation
to another this result tells us that, the <em>average</em> or
<em>amortized</em> cost of resizing is only constant.
<div class="pause">3</div>
Recall how the resize() operation works during an add(i,x) operation.
<div class="pause">1</div>
When we try to add an element and $a$ is already full, we allocate a new
array of size $2n$ and copy the $n$ elements of $a$ into this new array.
<div class="pause">2</div>
After a remove() operation, the array $a$ may be less than one-third
full. We handle this the same way; we allocate a new array of size $2n$
and copy the $n$ elements of $a$ into this new array.
<div class="pause">3</div>
So that we can focus on a concrete value, our strategy is to study the
number of elements copied during all calls to resize(). This is good enough,
since all the work done in the resize() operations is proportional to the
number of elements copied.  We will show that during our sequence of $m$
operations, at most $2m$ elements are copied during all the calls to resize().
<div class="pause">3</div>
Now, consider the situation just before a resize() triggered by adding an element.  This happens when $a$ is completely full; the length of $a$ is equal to $n$.
<div class="pause">2</pause>
If we look back to the most recent resize() operation---the one that allocated the current array, $a$, we see that, right after that resize() operation, $a$ was exactly half full.  It contained exactly $n/2$ elements.
<div class="pause">2</pause>
Since $a$ now contains $n$ elements, we can conclude that an additional
$n/2$ elements were added since the last resize() operation.
<div class="pause">2</pause>
This means that, between the previous and current resize() operations at least $n/2$ add(i,x) operations were performed.
<div class="pause">3</pause>
Next, consider the situation just before a resize() triggered by the removal of an element.   This happens when $a$ is less than one third full; $n$ is less than one third the length of $a$.
<div class="pause">2</pause>
Again, if we look back to the situation immediately after the most recent resize() operation we see that, at that time, the array $a$ was exactly half full.  Since the difference between one half and one third is one sixth, we conclude that at least $n/2$ elements must have been removed from $a$ in the meantime.
<div class="pause">2</pause>
To summarize, it doesn't matter whether a resize() is trigged by an add or a remove operation.  If the upcoming resize() operation is going to copy $n$ elements, then at least $n/2$ add or remove operations have occured since the previous resize() operation.
