An ArrayStack implements the list interface using an array, \(a\). The $i$th list item is stored at array index $i$.

<div class="pause">1</div>

A counter, $n$, keeps track of the number of elements in the ArrayStack.

<div class="pause">1</div>

Usually, the length of $a$ is not exactly $n$&mdash;the array has room for some additional elements.

<div class="pause">3</div>

The get(i) operation is easy to implement;  we just return the $i$th value in $a$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

The set(i,x) operation is just as easy to implement.  We set the $i$th value in $a$ equal to $x$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

The add(i,x) operation requires a little more work. Before we can add $x$ at location $i$, $n-i$ elements must be shifted one position to the right to make room for $x$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

Once this shifting is done, we can place $x$ at array location $i$ and increment the value of $n$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

The special case $i=n$ is simpler, since nothing needs to be shifted.

<div class="pause">3</div>

All of this assumes that there is room in $a$ for one more element. Occasionally, we may try to add an element when $a$ is already full. 

<div class="pause">3</div>

Before we can add the new element, we have to grow $a$. To do this we allocate a new array of length $2n$ and copy all the $n$ elements from $a$ into this new array.

<div class="pause">3</div>

This new array then becomes our next array, $a$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

After this resize() operation, there is room in $a$ to finish the add(i,x) operation as usual.

<div class="pause">3</div>

The remove(i) operation is implemented as expected. We first remove the $i$th element from $a$. This leaves a hole in $a$ that we fill by shifting $n-i-1$ elements.

<div class="pause">3</div>

Once this shifting is done, we decrement the value of $n$.

<div class="pause">3</div>

Like adding, removing from the end of the list is faster, since nothing needs to be shifted.

<div class="pause">4</div>

Eventually, if we remove enough elements, $a$ starts to become very empty.

<div class="pause">2</div>

If we reach a point where more than two thirds of $a$ is empty, then we resize() it.

<div class="pause">2</div>

As before, we allocate an array of length $2n$ and copy the $n$ elements of $a$ into this new array.

<div class="pause">4</div>

This new array becomes the next array, $a$.

<div class="pause">4</div>

An ArrayStack is a nice simple implementation of the List interface and the running time of ArrayStack operations are easy to analyze&mdash;except for the resize() operations.
<p>
To get around this, we'll ignore the cost of resize()&mdash;for now.
<div class="pause">2</div>
The get(i) and set(i) operations are simple array accesses that each take constant time.
<div class="pause">2</div>
The add(i,x) operation requires shifting $n-i$ elements of $a$, which takes an additional $O(n-i)$ time.
<div class="pause">2</div>
Similarly, the remove(i) operation requires shifting $n-i-1$ elements of $a$, which also takes an additional $O(n-i)$ time.

<div class="pause">4</div>
So far so good, but we can't just ignore things we don't understand;  we still have to account for calls to resize(), which is what we'll do in the next module.
